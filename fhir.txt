User Story:

As a healthcare provider system,
I want the Provider Service to map and translate appointment data from Meddbase into FHIR-compliant Slot resources,
So that I can support appointment scheduling in a standardized format.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	The Slot API should include a custom operation to combine serviceCategory, appointmentType, appointmentFormat, and appointmentDuration into a composite key for translation.
	•	The composite key should be used to retrieve matching appointments from Meddbase and translate them into the FHIR Slot format.
	•	The translation service should support one-to-one and one-to-many mappings, with prioritized fallback logic for cases with multiple mappings.

Tech Notes:
Refer to the [Non-FHIR EHR Integration Guide] for detailed integration instructions.



User Story:

As a healthcare provider system,
I want the Slot API response to include a contained FHIR Schedule resource with Meddbase-specific attributes,
So that I can support booking confirmations with the necessary metadata.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Each Slot API response embeds a FHIR Schedule resource containing Meddbase-specific data required for booking confirmation.
	•	Both Slot and contained Schedule resources follow FHIR R4 standards, ensuring consistent field mapping for booking requirements.
	•	Confirm integration of Google FHIR Store systems with the Provider Service’s translation functionality, allowing translation of non-FHIR data into FHIR-compliant Schedule attributes.

Tech Notes:
Refer to the [Non-FHIR EHR Integration Guide] for integration details.
