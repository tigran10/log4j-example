User Story:

As a healthcare provider system,
I want the Provider Service to map and translate appointment data from Meddbase into FHIR-compliant Slot resources,
So that I can support appointment scheduling in a standardized format.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	The Slot API should include a custom operation to combine serviceCategory, appointmentType, appointmentFormat, and appointmentDuration into a composite key for translation.
	•	The composite key should be used to retrieve matching appointments from Meddbase and translate them into the FHIR Slot format.
	•	The translation service should support one-to-one and one-to-many mappings, with prioritized fallback logic for cases with multiple mappings.

Tech Notes:
Refer to the [Non-FHIR EHR Integration Guide] for detailed integration instructions.

This version focuses on the functionality and requirements in a clear, concise way without role-specific language.
