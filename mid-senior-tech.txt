	•	Use OpenTelemetry and Google Cloud metrics for observability, and ensure systems are well-instrumented and monitored.
	•	Ensure code quality through automated testing and participate actively in code reviews.
	•	Collaborate on integrations with internal and external systems, using RESTful APIs and webhooks as needed.

What You’ll Need

	•	5-6 years of experience with Java and Spring Boot in microservices architecture.
	•	Proficient SQL skills, with hands-on experience in relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
	•	Familiarity with DevOps practices (CI/CD, infrastructure as code) and Linux.
	•	Basic knowledge of NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) is a plus.
	•	Comfort with troubleshooting in cloud-based environments (GCP, Terraform, and Helm).
	•	A collaborative, quality-focused mindset with a commitment to building maintainable, reliable code.

Nice-to-Have

	•	Exposure to messaging or queuing systems (Kafka, Google Pub/Sub, etc.).
	•	Knowledge of healthcare data standards like FHIR.
